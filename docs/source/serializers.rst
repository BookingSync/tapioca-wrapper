Serializers
===========


Currently, serializers are only capable of deserilizing data but in future releases they will also be capable of serializing.

**Deserialization**: is the transformation of a data which is in a serialized format (eg.: text) into a native format. For example, this could be transforming a string containing a date into a native python ``Datetime`` instance.

SimpleSerializer

``SimpleSerialzer`` is a very basic and generic serializer. It is included by default in adapters unless explicitly removed.
